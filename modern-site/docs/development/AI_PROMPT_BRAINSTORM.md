## Proposed Enhanced Prompt Structure

### Section 0: Industry Awareness & Design Inspiration (NEW - CRITICAL)
```
INDUSTRY AWARENESS & DESIGN INSPIRATION:

Before designing, identify the business industry and think about the MAJOR PLAYERS 
in that industry. Use their design philosophies as inspiration for creating a 
high-caliber website.

Examples:
- Clothing/Fashion E-commerce → Think Nike, Adidas, Zara (clean, modern, product-focused)
- Technology/SaaS → Think Apple, Microsoft, Stripe (minimalist, premium, clear messaging)
- Food & Beverage → Think Starbucks, McDonald's (warm, inviting, visual)
- Real Estate → Think Zillow, Realtor.com (trustworthy, professional, image-heavy)
- Healthcare → Think Mayo Clinic, WebMD (clean, trustworthy, accessible)
- Finance → Think Stripe, Square (professional, secure, modern)
- Creative/Portfolio → Think Behance, Dribbble (visual, creative, showcase-focused)
- Local Services → Think Yelp, Thumbtack (local, trustworthy, review-focused)

If the business doesn't fit a clear industry category, think about what makes a 
HIGH-CALIBER website in that space:
- What would a $1M+ company in this space look like?
- What design elements convey premium quality?
- What would make a visitor think "This is a serious, professional business"?

Use Unsplash images strategically:
- Hero sections: High-quality, relevant images
- Product/service pages: Contextual images
- About sections: Professional, appropriate imagery
- Use Unsplash URLs: https://images.unsplash.com/photo-[id]?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop
- Always include proper alt text for accessibility
